"""moxi-mc-flow's MoXI -> MoXI-JSON step, with room to recurse.

    moxi2json_gate.py <in.moxi> <out.json>

`--with-lets` is mandatory for correctness (without it the frozen definitions
land in `:inv`, which MoXIchecker asserts at both the current and the next
state, silently turning REACHABLE into UNREACHABLE).  It also makes the term
tree as deep as the `let` chain is long, and both `Program.to_json()` and
`json.dump` walk that tree recursively.  The JSON is written compact: at
`indent=4` the indentation itself is proportional to the depth, so a deep
let-chain turns a 500 KB model into gigabytes of whitespace.  On the larger CHC-COMP models the walk
runs out of Python stack: `src/moxi2json.py` catches the first `RecursionError`
and retries at a limit of 20 000, which is still short for a chain of tens of
thousands of `let` bindings.

Raising `sys.setrecursionlimit` alone would segfault -- the limit is a counter,
the real constraint is the C stack -- so the work runs on a thread with a stack
big enough to hold the frames.  The tool itself is imported, never modified.
